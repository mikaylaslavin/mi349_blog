    <p>Hello, I'm Mikayla! I am a Senior at Michigan State University studying Information Science with a focus in Human Centered Technologies and minors in Graphic Design and Business. In addition, I am pursuing a Masters degree in Media and Information, specifically in UX and HCI. With an expected graduation date of May 2024, I am currently working towards a career in UX Design!

    <p>Beyond my academic commitments, I am actively involved in several extracurricular activities. Presently, I hold the position of Vice President within the Michigan State Chapter of the American Institute of Graphic Arts. In addition, I am an active member of Michigan State Canvases for Communities and a member of the Student Allocation Board. Furthermore, I am working as a Graphic Design Intern at the MSU Burgess Institute for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. </p>

    <p>Outside of school I love to spend time with my family and friends. Recently I have been visiting my grand parents up north in Cadillac, MI and enjoying the beautiful scenery. Over the years I have also picked up several hobbies. Check them out below!</p>
